# Downloading an Archive in Amazon Glacier<a name="downloading-an-archive"></a>

Amazon Glacier provides a management console, which you can use to create and delete vaults\. However, you cannot download archives from Amazon Glacier by using the management console\. To download data, such as photos, videos, and other documents, you must either use the AWS CLI or write code to make requests, by using either the REST API directly or by using the AWS SDKs\. 

For information about using Amazon Glacier with the AWS CLI, see [AWS CLI Reference for Amazon Glacier](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/glacier/index.html)\. To install the AWS CLI, see [AWS Command Line Interface](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/)\. The following **Downloading an Archive** topics describe how to download archives to Amazon Glacier by using the AWS SDK for Java, the AWS SDK for \.NET, and the REST API\.
